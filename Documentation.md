To set up a Node.js project, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the desired directory, and run the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RaniKamna/zomato-backend.git
   ```

2. **Install Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

3. **Navigate to the project directory**: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   cd zomato-backend
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**: Most Node.js projects have dependencies listed in a `package.json` file. To install these dependencies, run the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the project**: After the dependencies are installed and the project is configured, you can start the project using the appropriate command. Commonly, projects provide a `start` script in the `package.json` file. To start the project, run:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
